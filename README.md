# Basic Interpreter written in TS

## Desc:

This is a side-project, little hobby thingy without any actual purpose.
I don't have any expierience nor knowledge regarding interpreter implementation, hence this is purely an educational endeavor.
I intend on developing this interpreter in my spare time whenever I desire to do so (hopefully more than once).

I'm making this repository public as means of motivating myself to actually "_finish the job_", as I feel that live recording will have a positive impact on my commitment (yeah... I do struggle with finishing stuff).

## Goals/Expectations:

I don't set any time restraints for myself, but I do intend on finishing it.
By the end of it, I want to have a **BASIC** tiny-scale interpreter for my custom language abomination.

### Functionality:

These are the main things (as of now) I want my interpreter to handle:

- Number/string literals
- Comments
- Binary expressions
- Variable declarations/assignments
- Variable environments
- Array/object structures
- Some form of build-in routines/procedures
- Native built-in functions
- Conditionals like `if` statements
- Some form of a loop

And other little things that I'll implement along the way!
